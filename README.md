# Pneumonia Detection using AlexNet (Google Colab + Gradio)

This project builds a **Pneumonia Detection** system using a modified **AlexNet CNN architecture**. It uses the [Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) dataset from Kaggle and runs entirely on **Google Colab** with a **Gradio-based web interface** for real-time predictions.
